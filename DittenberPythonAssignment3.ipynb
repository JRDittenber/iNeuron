    "In a Python program, there is only one global scope. A global scope contains all global variables and functions. A local scope, on the other hand, is created every time a function is called. The local scope contains local variables and functions defined within the function. The number of local scopes in a Python program depends on the number of functions that are called.\n"

    "\n",
    "When a function call returns, the local scope is destroyed and all the variables and functions defined within the local scope are no longer accessible. This is because local scopes in Python are created and destroyed dynamically, as functions are called and return. This is known as \"dynamic scoping\" and is different from \"static scoping\", where the scope of a variable is determined at compile time."
